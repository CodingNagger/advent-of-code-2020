# advent-of-code-2020

Going through the Advent of code 2020 using Golang. Should be a fun ride. Also I have a blog if you want you can [check it out here](https://www.codingnagger.com/) or ping me on [Twitter @CodingNagger](https://twitter.com/CodingNagger).

## How to run it

```
go run ./cmd/app
```

## Running tests

```
go test ./...
```

Looks like some unimportant tests for days 24 and 19 broke with my final solutions. Don't run the command. I won't fix them, they probably should be deleted 
but since I'm not sure I'll leave them there forever.
